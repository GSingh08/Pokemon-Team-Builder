Project name and description

-my project name "Pokemon Team Builder" and it allows you to click on a pokemon and view all of their information along with its picture. Underneath the pokemon there is a pulldown bar that you can click on and pick a team of your choice to add that specific pokemon to. You are also able to delete that pokemon if you do not want him on your team.
